# Fuzzy-Based Traffic Light Control System

This project demonstrates a **Fuzzy Logic based traffic light control system** using MATLAB.  
It simulates three different traffic modes:
1. **Random Traffic Simulation**
2. **Manual Traffic Simulation**
3. **Single Input Green Light Calculation**

Each simulation shows how fuzzy rules adapt the green light time dynamically based on traffic conditions.
